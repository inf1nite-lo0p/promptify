# âœ¨ Promptify

**Promptify** is my personal collection of prompts I use with AI tools like ChatGPT.

I use it to save time and avoid rewriting the same instructions over and over. The prompts are written clearly and are ready to reuse whenever I need them.

## ðŸ“¦ Prompt Library

All prompts are stored in the `prompts/` folder.

| Prompt                                                                                                                |

## ðŸš€ How I Use This

1. I browse the prompt I need inside the `prompts/` folder
2. I paste it into ChatGPT or a similar tool
3. I add my input (like API routes or schemas)
4. I get a useful response ready to copy and use
